                                The letters which ye sent during the war were
                                not received, but a letter dated February 11th,
                                1916, has just come to hand, and immediately an
                                answer is being written. Your intention deserves
                                a thousand praises, because you are serving the
                                world of humanity, and this is conducive to the
                                happiness and welfare of all. This recent war
                                has proved to the world and the people that war
                                is destruction while universal peace is
                                construction; war is death while peace is life;
                                war is rapacity and bloodthirstiness while peace
                                is beneficence and humaneness; war is an
                                appurtenance of the world of nature while peace
                                is of the foundation of the religion of God; war
                                is darkness upon darkness while peace is
                                heavenly light; war is the destroyer of the
                                edifice of mankind while peace is the
                                everlasting life of the world of humanity; war
                                is like a devouring wolf while peace is like the
                                angels of heaven; war is the struggle for
                                existence while peace is mutual aid and
                                cooperation among the peoples of the world and
                                the cause of the good pleasure of the True One
                                in the heavenly realm.

                                There is not one soul whose conscience does not
                                testify that in this day there is no more
                                important matter in the world than that of
                                universal peace. Every just one bears witness to
                                this and adores that esteemed Assembly because
                                its aim is that this darkness may be changed
                                into light, this bloodthirstiness into kindness,
                                this torment into bliss, this hardship into ease
                                and this enmity and hatred into fellowship and
                                love. Therefore, the effort of those esteemed
                                souls is worthy of praise and commendation.
                            </p>

                                But the wise souls who are aware of the
                                essential relationships emanating from the
                                realities of things consider that one single
                                matter cannot, by itself, influence the human
                                reality as it ought and should, for until the
                                minds of men become united, no important matter
                                can be accomplished. At present universal peace
                                is a matter of great importance, but unity of
                                conscience is essential, so that the foundation
                                of this matter may become secure, its
                                establishment firm and its edifice strong.
                            </p>

                                Therefore Bahá’u’lláh, fifty years ago,
                                expounded this question of universal peace at a
                                time when He was confined in the fortress of
                                ‘Akká and was wronged and imprisoned. He wrote
                                about this important matter of universal peace
                                to all the great sovereigns of the world, and
                                established it among His friends in the Orient.
                                The horizon of the East was in utter darkness,
                                nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity
                                towards each other, religions thirsted for each
                                other’s blood, and it was darkness upon
                                darkness. At such a time Bahá’u’lláh shone forth
                                like the sun from the horizon of the east and
                                illumined Persia with the lights of these
                                teachings.
                            </p>
                            <p id="tth_en-1-p6">
                                <a id="237517291" class="brl-location"/>
                                Among His teachings was the declaration of
                                universal peace. People of different nations,
                                religions and sects who followed Him came
                                together to such an extent that remarkable
                                gatherings were instituted consisting of the
                                various nations and religions of the East. Every
                                soul who entered these gatherings saw but one
                                nation, one teaching, one pathway, one order,
                                for the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh were not
                                limited to the establishment of universal peace.
                                They embraced many teachings which supplemented
                                and supported that of universal peace.
                            </p>

                                <a id="238114283" class="brl-location"/>
                                Among these teachings was the independent
                                investigation of reality so that the world of
                                humanity may be saved from the darkness of
                                imitation and attain to the truth; may tear off
                                and cast away this ragged and outgrown garment
                                of a thousand years ago and may put on the robe
                                woven in the utmost purity and holiness in the
                                loom of reality. As reality is one and cannot
                                admit of multiplicity, therefore different
                                opinions must ultimately become fused into one.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                                oneness of the world of humanity; that all human
                                beings are the sheep of God and He is the kind
                                Shepherd. This Shepherd is kind to all the
                                sheep, because He created them all, trained
                                them, provided for them and protected them.
                                There is no doubt that the Shepherd is kind to
                                all the sheep and should there be among these
                                sheep ignorant ones, they must be educated; if
                                there be children, they must be trained until
                                they reach maturity; if there be sick ones, they
                                must be cured. There must be no hatred and
                                enmity, for as by a kind physician these
                                ignorant, sick ones should be treated.
                            </p>

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                                religion must be the cause of fellowship and
                                love. If it becomes the cause of estrangement
                                then it is not needed, for religion is like a
                                remedy; if it aggravates the disease then it
                                becomes unnecessary.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                                religion must be in conformity with science and
                                reason, so that it may influence the hearts of
                                men. The foundation must be solid and must not
                                consist of imitations.

                                religious, racial, political, economic and
                                patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of
                                humanity. As long as these prejudices prevail,
                                the world of humanity will not have rest. For a
                                period of 6,000 years history informs us about
                                the world of humanity. During these 6,000 years
                                the world of humanity has not been free from
                                war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness. In
                                every period war has been waged in one country
                                or another and that war was due to either
                                religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political
                                prejudice or patriotic prejudice. It has
                                therefore been ascertained and proved that all
                                prejudices are destructive of the human edifice.
                                As long as these prejudices persist, the
                                struggle for existence must remain dominant, and
                                bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue.
                                Therefore, even as was the case in the past, the
                                world of humanity cannot be saved from the
                                darkness of nature and cannot attain
                                illumination except through the abandonment of
                                prejudices and the acquisition of the morals of
                                the Kingdom.

                                If this prejudice and enmity are on account of
                                religion consider that religion should be the
                                cause of fellowship, otherwise it is fruitless.
                                And if this prejudice be the prejudice of
                                nationality consider that all mankind are of one
                                nation; all have sprung from the tree of Adam,
                                and Adam is the root of the tree. That tree is
                                one and all these nations are like branches,
                                while the individuals of humanity are like
                                leaves, blossoms and fruits thereof. Then the
                                establishment of various nations and the
                                consequent shedding of blood and destruction of
                                the edifice of humanity result from human
                                ignorance and selfish motives.

                                As to the patriotic prejudice, this is also due
                                to absolute ignorance, for the surface of the
                                earth is one native land. Every one can live in
                                any spot on the terrestrial globe. Therefore all
                                the world is man’s birthplace. These boundaries
                                and outlets have been devised by man. In the
                                creation, such boundaries and outlets were not
                                assigned. Europe is one continent, Asia is one
                                continent, Africa is one continent, Australia is
                                one continent, but some of the souls, from
                                personal motives and selfish interests, have
                                divided each one of these continents and
                                considered a certain part as their own country.
                                God has set up no frontier between France and
                                Germany; they are continuous. Yet, in the first
                                centuries, selfish souls, for the promotion of
                                their own interests, have assigned boundaries
                                and outlets and have, day by day, attached more
                                importance to these, until this led to intense
                                enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in subsequent
                                centuries. In the same way this will continue
                                indefinitely, and if this conception of
                                patriotism remains limited within a certain
                                circle, it will be the primary cause of the
                                world’s destruction. No wise and just person
                                will acknowledge these imaginary distinctions.
                                Every limited area which we call our native
                                country we regard as our motherland, whereas the
                                terrestrial globe is the motherland of all, and
                                not any restricted area. In short, for a few
                                days we live on this earth and eventually we are
                                buried in it, it is our eternal tomb. Is it
                                worth while that we should engage in bloodshed
                                and tear one another to pieces for this eternal
                                tomb? Nay, far from it, neither is God pleased
                                with such conduct nor would any sane man approve
                                of it.

                                Consider! The blessed animals engage in no
                                patriotic quarrels. They are in the utmost
                                fellowship with one another and live together in
                                harmony. For example, if a dove from the east
                                and a dove from the west, a dove from the north
                                and a dove from the south chance to arrive, at
                                the same time, in one spot, they immediately
                                associate in harmony. So is it with all the
                                blessed animals and birds. But the ferocious
                                animals, as soon as they meet, attack and fight
                                with each other, tear each other to pieces and
                                it is impossible for them to live peaceably
                                together in one spot. They are all unsociable
                                and fierce, savage and combative fighters.

                                Regarding the economic prejudice, it is apparent
                                that whenever the ties between nations become
                                strengthened and the exchange of commodities
                                accelerated, and any economic principle is
                                established in one country, it will ultimately
                                affect the other countries and universal
                                benefits will result. Then why this prejudice?

                                As to the political prejudice, the policy of God
                                must be followed and it is indisputable that the
                                policy of God is greater than human policy. We
                                must follow the Divine policy and that applies
                                alike to all individuals. He treats all
                                individuals alike: no distinction is made, and
                                that is the foundation of the Divine Religions.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                                origination of one language that may be spread
                                universally among the people. This teaching was
                                revealed from the pen of Bahá’u’lláh in order
                                that this universal language may eliminate
                                misunderstandings from among mankind.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                                equality of women and men. The world of humanity
                                has two wings—one is women and the other men.
                                Not until both wings are equally developed can
                                the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak,
                                flight is impossible. Not until the world of
                                women becomes equal to the world of men in the
                                acquisition of virtues and perfections, can
                                success and prosperity be attained as they ought
                                to be.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is
                                voluntary sharing of one’s property with others
                                among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater
                                than equality, and consists in this, that man
                                should not prefer himself to others, but rather
                                should sacrifice his life and property for
                                others. But this should not be introduced by
                                coercion so that it becomes a law and man is
                                compelled to follow it. Nay, rather, man should
                                voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his
                                property and life for others, and spend
                                willingly for the poor, just as is done in
                                Persia among the Bahá’ís.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is man’s
                                freedom, that through the ideal Power he should
                                be free and emancipated from the captivity of
                                the world of nature; for as long as man is
                                captive to nature he is a ferocious animal, as
                                the struggle for existence is one of the
                                exigencies of the world of nature. This matter
                                of the struggle for existence is the
                                fountain-head of all calamities and is the
                                supreme affliction.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                                religion is a mighty bulwark. If the edifice of
                                religion shakes and totters, commotion and chaos
                                will ensue and the order of things will be
                                utterly upset, for in the world of mankind there
                                are two safeguards that protect man from
                                wrongdoing. One is the law which punishes the
                                criminal; but the law prevents only the manifest
                                crime and not the concealed sin; whereas the
                                ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of God,
                                prevents both the manifest and the concealed
                                crime, trains man, educates morals, compels the
                                adoption of virtues and is the all-inclusive
                                power which guarantees the felicity of the world
                                of mankind. But by religion is meant that which
                                is ascertained by investigation and not that
                                which is based on mere imitation, the
                                foundations of Divine Religions and not human
                                imitations.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                                although material civilization is one of the
                                means for the progress of the world of mankind,
                                yet until it becomes combined with Divine
                                civilization, the desired result, which is the
                                felicity of mankind, will not be attained.
                                Consider! These battleships that reduce a city
                                to ruins within the space of an hour are the
                                result of material civilization; likewise the
                                Krupp guns, the Mauser rifles, dynamite,
                                submarines, torpedo boats, armed aircraft and
                                bombers—all these weapons of war are the
                                malignant fruits of material civilization. Had
                                material civilization been combined with Divine
                                civilization, these fiery weapons would never
                                have been invented. Nay, rather, human energy
                                would have been wholly devoted to useful
                                inventions and would have been concentrated on
                                praiseworthy discoveries. Material civilization
                                is like a lamp-glass. Divine civilization is the
                                lamp itself and the glass without the light is
                                dark. Material civilization is like the body. No
                                matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and
                                beautiful it may be, it is dead. Divine
                                civilization is like the spirit, and the body
                                gets its life from the spirit, otherwise it
                                becomes a corpse. It has thus been made evident
                                that the world of mankind is in need of the
                                breaths of the Holy Spirit. Without the spirit
                                the world of mankind is lifeless, and without
                                this light the world of mankind is in utter
                                darkness. For the world of nature is an animal
                                world. Until man is born again from the world of
                                nature, that is to say, becomes detached from
                                the world of nature, he is essentially an
                                animal, and it is the teachings of God which
                                convert this animal into a human soul.

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                                promotion of education. Every child must be
                                instructed in sciences as much as is necessary.
                                If the parents are able to provide the expenses
                                of this education, it is well, otherwise the
                                community must provide the means for the
                                teaching of that child.
                            </p>

                                And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are
                                justice and right. Until these are realized on
                                the plane of existence, all things shall be in
                                disorder and remain imperfect. The world of
                                mankind is a world of oppression and cruelty,
                                and a realm of aggression and error.
                            </p>
                            <p id="tth_en-1-p25">
                                <a id="376814060" class="brl-location"/>
                                In fine, such teachings are numerous. These
                                manifold principles, which constitute the
                                greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and
                                are of the bounties of the Merciful, must be
                                added to the matter of universal peace and
                                combined with it, so that results may accrue.
                                Otherwise the realization of universal peace by
                                itself in the world of mankind is difficult. As
                                the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are combined with
                                universal peace, they are like a table provided
                                with every kind of fresh and delicious food.
                                Every soul can find, at that table of infinite
                                bounty, that which he desires. If the question
                                is restricted to universal peace alone, the
                                remarkable results which are expected and
                                desired will not be attained. The scope of
                                universal peace must be such that all the
                                communities and religions may find their highest
                                wish realized in it. The teachings of
                                Bahá’u’lláh are such that all the communities of
                                the world, whether religious, political or
                                ethical, ancient or modern, find in them the
                                expression of their highest wish.

                                For example, the people of religions find, in
                                the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the establishment
                                of Universal Religion—a religion that perfectly
                                conforms with present conditions, which in
                                reality effects the immediate cure of the
                                incurable disease, which relieves every pain,
                                and bestows the infallible antidote for every
                                deadly poison. For if we wish to arrange and
                                organize the world of mankind in accordance with
                                the present religious imitations and thereby to
                                establish the felicity of the world of mankind,
                                it is impossible and impracticable—for example,
                                the enforcement of the laws of the Torah and
                                also of the other religions in accordance with
                                present imitations. But the essential basis of
                                all the Divine Religions which pertains to the
                                virtues of the world of mankind and is the
                                foundation of the welfare of the world of man,
                                is found in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh in the
                                most perfect presentation.

                                Similarly, with regard to the peoples who
                                clamour for freedom: the moderate freedom which
                                guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind
                                and maintains and preserves the universal
                                relationships, is found in its fullest power and
                                extension in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

                                So with regard to political parties: that which
                                is the greatest policy directing the world of
                                mankind, nay, rather, the Divine policy, is
                                found in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

                                Likewise with regard to the party of “equality”
                                which seeks the solution of the economic
                                problems: until now all proposed solutions have
                                proved impracticable except the economic
                                proposals in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh which
                                are practicable and cause no distress to
                                society.
                            </p>

                                So with the other parties: when ye look deeply
                                into this matter, ye will discover that the
                                highest aims of those parties are found in the
                                teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. These teachings
                                constitute the all-inclusive power among all men
                                and are practicable. But there are some
                                teachings of the past, such as those of the
                                Torah, which cannot be carried out at the
                                present day. It is the same with the other
                                religions and the tenets of the various sects
                                and the different parties.
                            </p>
                            <p id="tth_en-1-p31">
                                <a id="168313836" class="brl-location"/>
                                For example, the question of universal peace,
                                about which Bahá’u’lláh says that the Supreme
                                Tribunal must be established: although the
                                League of Nations has been brought into
                                existence, yet it is incapable of establishing
                                universal peace. But the Supreme Tribunal which
                                Bahá’u’lláh has described will fulfil this
                                sacred task with the utmost might and power. And
                                His plan is this: that the national assemblies
                                of each country and nation—that is to say
                                parliaments—should elect two or three persons
                                who are the choicest of that nation, and are
                                well informed concerning international laws and
                                the relations between governments and aware of
                                the essential needs of the world of humanity in
                                this day. The number of these representatives
                                should be in proportion to the number of
                                inhabitants of that country. The election of
                                these souls who are chosen by the national
                                assembly, that is, the parliament, must be
                                confirmed by the upper house, the congress and
                                the cabinet and also by the president or monarch
                                so these persons may be the elected ones of all
                                the nation and the government. The Supreme
                                Tribunal will be composed of these people, and
                                all mankind will thus have a share therein, for
                                every one of these delegates is fully
                                representative of his nation. When the Supreme
                                Tribunal gives a ruling on any international
                                question, either unanimously or by majority
                                rule, there will no longer be any pretext for
                                the plaintiff or ground of objection for the
                                defendant. In case any of the governments or
                                nations, in the execution of the irrefutable
                                decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent
                                or dilatory, the rest of the nations will rise
                                up against it, because all the governments and
                                nations of the world are the supporters of this
                                Supreme Tribunal. Consider what a firm
                                foundation this is! But by a limited and
                                restricted League the purpose will not be
                                realized as it ought and should. This is the
                                truth about the situation, which has been
                                stated.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"

                                Consider how powerful are the teachings of
                                Bahá’u’lláh. At a time when He was in the prison
                                of ‘Akká and was under the restrictions and
                                threats of two bloodthirsty kings, His
                                teachings, notwithstanding this fact, spread
                                with all power in Persia and other countries.
                                Should any teaching, or any principle, or any
                                community fall under the threat of a powerful
                                and bloodthirsty monarch, it would be
                                annihilated within a short space of time. At
                                present and for fifty years the Bahá’ís in
                                Persia and most regions have been under severe
                                restrictions and the threat of sword and spear.
                                Thousands of souls have given their lives in the
                                arena of sacrifice and have fallen as victims
                                under the swords of oppression and cruelty.
                                Thousands of esteemed families have been
                                uprooted and destroyed. Thousands of children
                                have been made fatherless. Thousands of fathers
                                have been bereft of their sons. Thousands of
                                mothers have wept and lamented for their boys
                                who have been beheaded. All this oppression and
                                cruelty, rapacity and bloodthirstiness did not
                                hinder or prevent the spread of the teachings of
                                Bahá’u’lláh. They spread more and more every
                                day, and their power and might became more
                                evident.

                                It may be that some foolish person among the
                                Persians will affix his name to the contents of
                                the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh or to the
                                explanations given in the letters of
                                ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and send it to that esteemed
                                Assembly. Ye must be aware of this fact, for any
                                Persian who seeks fame or has some other
                                intention will take the entire contents of the
                                Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh and publish them in his
                                own name or in that of his community, just as
                                happened at the Universal Races Congress in
                                London before the war. A Persian took the
                                substance of the Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh,
                                entered that Congress, gave them forth in his
                                own name and published them, whereas the wording
                                was exactly that of Bahá’u’lláh. Some such souls
                                have gone to Europe and have caused confusion in
                                the minds of the people of Europe and have
                                disturbed the thoughts of some Orientalists. Ye
                                must bear this fact in mind, for not a word of
                                these teachings was heard in Persia before the
                                appearance of Bahá’u’lláh. Investigate this
                                matter so that it may become to you evident and
                                manifest. Some souls are like parrots. They
                                learn any note which they may hear, and sing it,
                                but they themselves are unaware of what they
                                utter. There is a sect in Persia at present made
                                up of a few souls who are called Bábís, who
                                claim to be followers of the Báb, whereas they
                                are utterly unaware of Him. They have some
                                secret teachings which are entirely opposed to
                                the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and in Persia
                                people know this. But when these souls come to
                                Europe, they conceal their own teachings and
                                utter those of Bahá’u’lláh, for they know that
                                the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are powerful and
                                they therefore declare publicly those teachings
                                of Bahá’u’lláh in their own name. As to their
                                secret teachings, they say that they are taken
                                from the Bayán and the Bayán is from the Báb.
                                When ye obtain the translation of the Bayán,
                                which has been translated in Persia, ye will
                                discover the truth that the teachings of
                                Bahá’u’lláh are utterly opposed to the teachings
                                of this sect. Beware lest ye disregard this
                                fact. Should ye desire to investigate the matter
                                further, enquire from Persia.

                                In brief, when you traverse the regions of the
                                world, you shall conclude that all progress is
                                the result of association and co-operation,
                                while ruin is the outcome of animosity and
                                hatred. Notwithstanding this, the world of
                                humanity does not take warning, nor does it
                                awake from the slumber of heedlessness. Man is
                                still causing differences, quarrels and strife
                                in order to marshal the cohorts of war and, with
                                his legions, rush into the field of bloodshed
                                and slaughter.

                                Then again, consider the phenomenon of
                                composition and decomposition, of existence and
                                non-existence. Every created thing in the
                                contingent world is made up of many and varied
                                atoms, and its existence is dependent on the
                                composition of these. In other words, a
                                conjunction of simple elements takes place so
                                that from this composition a distinct organism
                                is produced. The existence of all things is
                                based upon this principle. But when the order is
                                deranged, decomposition is produced and
                                disintegration sets in, then that thing ceases
                                to exist. That is, the annihilation of all
                                things is caused by decomposition and
                                disintegration. Therefore attraction and
                                composition between the various elements is the
                                means of life, and discord, and division produce
                                death. Thus the cohesive and attractive forces
                                in all things lead to the appearance of fruitful
                                results and effects, while estrangement and
                                alienation of things lead to disturbance and
                                annihilation. Through affinity and attraction
                                all living things like plants, animals and men
                                come into existence, while division and discord
                                bring about decomposition and destruction.
                            </p>

                                Consequently, that which is conducive to
                                association and attraction and unity among the
                                sons of men is the means of the life of the
                                world of humanity, and whatever causes division,
                                repulsion and remoteness leads to the death of
                                humankind.
                            </p>

                                And if, as you pass by fields and plantations,
                                where the plants, flowers and sweet-smelling
                                herbs are growing luxuriantly together, forming
                                a pattern of unity, this is an evidence of the
                                fact that that plantation and garden is
                                flourishing under the care of a skilful
                                gardener. But when you see it in a state of
                                disorder and irregularity you infer that it has
                                lacked the training of an efficient farmer and
                                thus has produced weeds and tares.

                                It therefore becomes manifest that amity and
                                cohesion are indicative of the training of the
                                Real Educator, and dispersion and separation a
                                proof of savagery and deprivation of divine
                                education.

                                A critic may object, saying that peoples, races,
                                tribes and communities of the world are of
                                different and varied customs, habits, tastes,
                                character, inclinations and ideas, that opinions
                                and thoughts are contrary to one another, and
                                how, therefore, is it possible for real unity to
                                be revealed and perfect accord among human souls
                                to exist?

                                In answer we say that differences are of two
                                kinds. One is the cause of annihilation and is
                                like the antipathy existing among warring
                                nations and conflicting tribes who seek each
                                other’s destruction, uprooting one another’s
                                families, depriving one another of rest and
                                comfort and unleashing carnage, and this is
                                blameworthy. The other kind which is a token of
                                diversity is the essence of perfection and the
                                cause of the appearance of divine bestowals.

                                Consider the flowers of a garden: though
                                differing in kind, colour, form and shape, yet,
                                inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of
                                one spring, revived by the breath of one wind,
                                invigorated by the rays of one sun, this
                                diversity increases their charm, and adds unto
                                their beauty. Thus when that unifying force, the
                                penetrating influence of the Word of God, takes
                                effect, the difference of customs, manners,
                                habits, ideas, opinions and dispositions
                                embellishes the world of humanity, and this is
                                praiseworthy. This diversity, this difference is
                                like the naturally created dissimilarity and
                                variety of the limbs and organs of the human
                                body, for each one contributes to the beauty,
                                efficiency and perfection of the whole. When
                                these different limbs and organs come under the
                                influence of man’s sovereign soul, and the
                                soul’s power pervades the limbs and members,
                                veins and arteries of the body, then difference
                                reinforces harmony, diversity strengthens love,
                                and multiplicity is the greatest factor for
                                co-ordination.

                                How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and
                                plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the
                                branches and the trees of that garden were all
                                of the same shape and colour! Diversity of hues,
                                form and shape, enriches and adorns the garden,
                                and heightens the effect thereof. In like
                                manner, when divers shades of thought,
                                temperament and character, are brought together
                                under the power and influence of one central
                                agency, the beauty and glory of human perfection
                                will be revealed and made manifest. Naught but
                                the celestial potency of the Word of God, which
                                rules and transcends the realities of all
                                things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent
                                thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of
                                the children of men. Verily, it is the
                                penetrating power in all things, the mover of
                                souls and the binder and regulator in the world
                                of humanity.

                                risen to illumine the whole earth, and to
                                spiritualize the community of man. Laudable are
                                the results and the fruits thereof, abundant the
                                holy evidences deriving from this grace. This is
                                mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light
                                for the world and all its peoples; it is harmony
                                and fellowship, and love and solidarity; indeed
                                it is compassion and unity, and the end of
                                foreignness; it is the being at one, in complete
                                dignity and freedom, with all on earth.

                                The Blessed Beauty saith: “Ye are all the fruits
                                of one tree, the leaves of one branch.” Thus
                                hath He likened this world of being to a single
                                tree, and all its peoples to the leaves thereof,
                                and the blossoms and fruits. It is needful for
                                the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to
                                flourish, and upon the interconnection of all

                                For this reason must all human beings powerfully
                                sustain one another and seek for everlasting
                                life; and for this reason must the lovers of God
                                in this contingent world become the mercies and
                                the blessings sent forth by that clement King of
                                the seen and unseen realms. Let them purify
                                their sight and behold all humankind as leaves
                                and blossoms and fruits of the tree of being.

                                offering to someone love, consideration,
                                thoughtful help. Let them see no one as their
                                enemy, or as wishing them ill, but think of all
                                humankind as their friends; regarding the alien
                                as an intimate, the stranger as a companion,
                                staying free of prejudice, drawing no lines.

                                to his fallen oppressor, a helping hand; it is

                                O ye dear friends! The world is at war and the
                                human race is in travail and mortal combat. The
                                dark night of hate hath taken over, and the
                                light of good faith is blotted out. The peoples
                                and kindreds of the earth have sharpened their
                                claws, and are hurling themselves one against
                                the other. It is the very foundation of the
                                human race that is being destroyed. It is
                                thousands of households that are vagrant and
                                dispossessed, and every year seeth thousands
                                upon thousands of human beings weltering in
                                their lifeblood on dusty battlefields. The tents
                                of life and joy are down. The generals practice
                                their generalship, boasting of the blood they
                                shed, competing one with the next in inciting to
                                violence. “With this sword,” saith one of them,
                                “I beheaded a people!” And another: “I toppled a
                                nation to the ground!” And yet another: “I
                                brought a government down!” On such things do
                                men pride themselves, in such do they glory!
                                Love—righteousness—these are everywhere
                                censured, while despised are harmony, and
                                devotion to the truth.

                                mankind to safety and love, to amity and peace;
                                it hath raised up its tabernacle on the heights
                                of the earth, and directeth its call to all
                                nations. Wherefore, O ye who are God’s lovers,
                                know ye the value of this precious Faith, obey
                                its teachings, walk in this road that is drawn

                                Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the
                                Kingdom. Spread far and wide the precepts and
                                counsels of the loving Lord, so that this world
                                will change into another world, and this
                                darksome earth will be flooded with light, and
                                the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so
                                that every soul will ask for immortality,
                                through the holy breaths of God.

                                Soon will your swiftly passing days be over, and
                                the fame and riches, the comforts, the joys

                                people to God, and invite humanity to follow the
                                example of the Company on high. Be ye loving

                                helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a
                                cure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every
                                victim of oppression, the patrons of the
                                disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of
                                rendering some service to every member of the
                                human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and
                                rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice: act
                                ye in the opposite way. Be ye sincerely kind,
                                not in appearance only. Let each one of God’s
                                loved ones centre his attention on this: to be
                                the Lord’s mercy to man; to be the Lord’s grace.
                                Let him do some good to every person whose path
                                he crosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let
                                him improve the character of each and all, and
                                reorient the minds of men. In this way, the
                                light of divine guidance will shine forth, and
                                the blessings of God will cradle all mankind:
                                for love is light, no matter in what abode it
                                dwelleth; and hate is darkness, no matter where
                                it may make its nest. O friends of God! That the
                                hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the
                                secret essence of all things may be disclosed,
                                strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and
                                ever.

                                We Bahá’ís have the greatest affinity for your
                                esteemed organization, and dispatched therefore
                                two distinguished individuals to you in order to
                                forge a strong bond. For in this day the cause
                                of universal peace is of paramount importance
                                amongst all human affairs and is the greatest
                                instrument for securing the very life and
                                felicity of mankind. Bereft of this effulgent
                                reality, humanity can in no wise find true
                                composure or real advancement but will, day by
                                day, sink ever deeper into misery and
                                wretchedness.

                                This last terrible war hath clearly proven that
                                humanity cannot withstand the effects of modern
                                instruments of warfare. The future can in no
                                wise be compared to the past, for earlier
                                weapons and armaments had but a feeble effect,
                                whilst modern ones can, in a brief span of time,
                                strike at the very roots of the world of
                                humanity and surpass the limits of its
                                endurance.

                                In this age, therefore, universal peace is like
                                unto the sun, which bestoweth life upon all
                                things, and it is thus incumbent upon all to
                                endeavour in the path of this mighty cause. Now,
                                we indeed share this common goal with you and
                                strive toward it with all our strength,
                                renouncing even our lives, our kindred, and our
                                substance for its sake.

                                As ye have no doubt heard, in Persia thousands
                                of souls have offered up their lives in this
                                path, and thousands of homes have been laid
                                waste. Despite this, we have in no wise
                                relented, but have continued to endeavour unto
                                this very moment and are increasing our efforts
                                as day followeth day, because our desire for
                                peace is not derived merely from the intellect:
                                It is a matter of religious belief and one of
                                the eternal foundations of the Faith of God.
                                That is why we strive with all our might and,
                                forsaking our own advantage, rest, and comfort,
                                forgo the pursuit of our own affairs; devote
                                ourselves to the mighty cause of peace; and
                                consider it to be the very foundation of the
                                Divine religions, a service to His Kingdom, the
                                source of eternal life, and the greatest means
                                of admittance into the heavenly realm.

                                Today the benefits of universal peace are
                                recognized amongst the people, and likewise the
                                harmful effects of war are clear and manifest to
                                all. But in this matter, knowledge alone is far
                                from sufficient: A power of implementation is
                                needed to establish it throughout the world. Ye
                                should therefore consider how the compelling
                                power of conscience can be awakened, so that
                                this lofty ideal may be translated from the
                                realm of thought into that of reality. For it is
                                clear and evident that the execution of this
                                mighty endeavour is impossible through ordinary
                                human feelings but requireth the powerful
                                sentiments of the heart to transform its
                                potential into reality.

                                Indeed, all on earth know that an upright
                                character is praiseworthy and acceptable and
                                that baseness of character is blameworthy and
                                rejected, that justice and fairness are favoured
                                and agreeable whilst cruelty and tyranny are
                                unacceptable and rejected. Notwithstanding this,
                                all people, but for a few, are devoid of a
                                praiseworthy character and bereft of a sense of
                                justice.

                                The power of conscience is therefore needed, and

                                may feel compelled to evince a goodly character.
                                It is our firm belief that the power of
                                implementation in this great endeavour is the
                                penetrating influence of the Word of God and the
